TalentView is a Business Intelligence–based HR analytics project designed to analyze employee
workforce data and attrition patterns within an organization. Employee attrition is a critical
challenge as it directly affects productivity, cost, and organizational stability.
The purpose of this project is to provide HR teams and management with a centralized, 
interactive dashboard that helps them understand workforce composition, monitor attrition trends, 
and evaluate hiring effectiveness. By using analytical dashboards, the project supports data-driven human resource decision-making.
